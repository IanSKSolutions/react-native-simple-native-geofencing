# react-native-simple-native-geofencing

A native geofencing implementation for Android and iOS that allows to natively post notification when entering/exiting specified geofences and to fire a react-native/javascript asynchronous function when leaving a specific monitoring geofence (see at the bottom of this README). This can be useful to trigger calculations of new Geofences when leaving one area.
